# XDK2MAM is open source software to bridge the Bosch XDK 110 and IOTA Tangle

The Bosch XDK 110 is a programmable sensor device & a prototyping platform for many IoT use cases, being used in the field of Internet of Production, mainly to measure the performance of industrial machinery.

On the other side, IOTA's Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) is a second layer data communication protocol which adds functionality to emit and access an encrypted data stream over the Tangle.

XDK2MAM main goal is to provide open source software to allow interaction between this powerful hardware and the promising IOTA Tangle.
The following repository has either files for the Bosch XDK 110 and for the data receiver in Node.js where the attach to Tangle via MAM happens.

**Current stable XDK Workbench version for this code is 3.4.0**
